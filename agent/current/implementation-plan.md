# Book Tracker Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This implementation plan outlines how we'll build the Book Tracker application on top of the existing FastAPI template, incorporating AI agents for enhanced functionality.

## 2. Existing Foundation

The template provides:
- User authentication & authorization
- Role-based access control
- Theme system
- Admin interface
- Database integration

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Book Management

1. Database Models
   ```mermaid
   erDiagram
       User ||--o{ Book : has
       Book {
           int id PK
           string title
           string author
           enum status
           text notes
           datetime start_date
           datetime completion_date
           int rating
           int user_id FK
       }
   ```

2. API Endpoints
   - Book CRUD operations
   - Reading status management
   - Rating system
   - Notes functionality

3. Frontend Templates
   - Book list view
   - Book detail view
   - Add/Edit book forms
   - Reading status filters

### Phase 2: AI Agent Integration

1. Book Management Agent

       B --> C[Book CRUD]
       B --> D[Status Management]
       B --> E[Smart Features]
       E --> F[Reading Time Estimation]
       E --> G[Book Recommendations]
       E --> H[Smart Categorization]
   ```

   - Integration with external book APIs
   - Smart categorization system
   - Reading time estimation
   - Book recommendations

2. User Management Agent
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[User Management Agent] --> B[User Functions]
       B --> C[Profile Management]
       B --> D[Reading Preferences]
       B --> E[Smart Features]
       E --> F[Reading Habit Analysis]
       E --> G[Personalized Recommendations]
   ```

   - Reading habit analysis
   - Preference management
   - Personalized recommendations

3. Analytics Agent
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Analytics Agent] --> B[Analytics Functions]
       B --> C[Reading Statistics]
       B --> D[Trend Analysis]
       B --> E[Smart Features]
       E --> F[Goal Tracking]
       E --> G[Progress Insights]
   ```

   - Reading statistics
   - Trend analysis
   - Goal tracking
   - Progress insights

4. Theme Agent
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Theme Agent] --> B[Theme Functions]
       B --> C[Theme Management]
       B --> D[UI Customization]
       B --> E[Smart Features]
       E --> F[Accessibility]
       E --> G[Reading Optimization]
   ```

   - Theme customization
   - Reading optimization
   - Accessibility features

### Phase 3: Frontend Enhancement

1. UI Components
   - Book grid/list views
   - Reading progress indicators
   - Rating interface
   - Status filters
   - Search & sort functionality

2. HTMX Integration
   - Dynamic updates
   - Inline editing
   - Real-time filtering
   - Smooth transitions

3. Theme Integration
   - Reading-optimized themes
   - Dark/light mode
   - Font optimization
   - Responsive design

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

1. Unit Tests
   - Model tests
   - API endpoint tests
   - Agent integration tests
   - Permission tests

2. Integration Tests
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Agent coordination
   - UI interactions
   - Theme switching

3. Performance Optimization
   - Database queries
   - Agent response times
   - Frontend loading
   - Cache implementation

## 4. Development Approach

1. Iterative Development
   - Build core features first
   - Add AI capabilities incrementally
   - Regular testing & feedback
   - Continuous integration

2. AI Agent Architecture
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       subgraph "Frontend"
           A[UI Components]
           B[HTMX]
           C[Theme System]
       end
       
       subgraph "Backend"
           D[FastAPI]
           E[Database]
           F[Auth System]
       end
       
       subgraph "AI Agents"
           G[Book Agent]
           H[User Agent]
           I[Analytics Agent]
           J[Theme Agent]
       end
       
       A --> B
       B --> D
       D --> E
       D --> F
       G --> D
       H --> D
       I --> D
       J --> C
   ```

3. Code Organization
