## Core Principles

1. **Focus on Current Task**

   - Keep notes focused and relevant

## Development Rules

1. **Task Workflow**
   - Review relevant context
   - Document approach in current/
   - Implement solution
   - Record completion in history/

2. **Code Standards**
   - Write testable code
   - Keep solutions simple
   - Document significant changes

3. **Quality Guidelines**
   - Validate against requirements
   - Test changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Stay Focused**
   - Work on one task at a time
   - Keep documentation minimal but clear
   - Clean up after task completion

2. **Maintain Context**
   - Reference relevant documentation
   - Document important decisions
   - Track significant changes

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
