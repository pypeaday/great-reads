# Book Tracker AI Rebuild Plan

This document outlines the plan for rebuilding the Book Tracker application with AI agents.

## 1. Application Overview

The Book Tracker is a modern, mobile-friendly web application that helps users manage their reading life. It's built with:
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLite
- Frontend: HTMX + Tailwind CSS
- Templates: Jinja2

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Interface] --> B[FastAPI Backend]
    B --> C[SQLite Database]
    B --> D[Authentication]
    B --> E[Theme System]
    A --> F[HTMX]
    A --> G[Tailwind CSS]
```

## 2. Technical Architecture

Current architecture:
```mermaid

    subgraph Frontend
        UI[User Interface] --> HTMX
        UI --> Tailwind
        UI --> Templates[Jinja2 Templates]
    end
    
    subgraph Backend
        API[FastAPI] --> Auth[Authentication]
        API --> DB[SQLite]
        API --> Theme[Theme System]
    end
    
    Frontend <--> Backend
```

## 3. Core Features

1. User Management
   - Registration/Login system
   - JWT-based authentication
   - User roles (admin/regular)

2. Book Management
   - Add/Edit/Delete books
   - Track reading status:
     * To Read
     * Currently Reading
     * Completed
     * On Hold
     * Did Not Finish (DNF)
   - Book metadata:
     * Title
     * Author
     * Notes
     * Start/Completion dates
     * Rating system (0-3)

3. Admin Features
   - User management
   - System statistics
   - Book usage analytics

4. Theme System
   - Multiple theme support
   - Theme persistence
   - Real-time theme switching

## 4. Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Book : has
    User {
        int id PK
        string email
        string hashed_password
        boolean is_active
        datetime created_at
        string role
    }
    Book {
        int id PK
        string title
        string author
        enum status
        text notes
        datetime start_date
        datetime completion_date
        int rating
        int user_id FK
    }
```

## 5. Proposed AI Agent Architecture

For rebuilding with AI agents, we'll split the system into these specialized agents:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "AI Agents"
        A[Book Management Agent] --> D[Core System]
        B[User Management Agent] --> D
        C[Analytics Agent] --> D
        E[Theme Agent] --> D
    end
    
    D --> F[FastAPI Backend]
    F --> G[Database]
    F --> H[Frontend]
```

### Agent Responsibilities

1. Book Management Agent

2. User Management Agent
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - User preferences
   - Profile management
   - Session handling
   - Reading habit analysis
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Social features coordination
   - Privacy management

3. Analytics Agent
   - Reading statistics
   - User behavior analysis
   - System metrics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Reading trend analysis
   - User engagement metrics
   - Book popularity tracking
   - Reading goal progress

4. Theme Agent
   - Theme management
   - UI customization
   - Accessibility features
   - Dynamic styling
   - Color scheme optimization
